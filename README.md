# Spatial transcriptomics reveals genes associated with dysregulated mitochondrial functions and stress signaling in Alzheimer's disease

This repo contains the analysis scripts used in the paper Navarro et al. iScience, 2020. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101556

Please keep mind this repository has been created for the sake of data sharing and transparence. 
The code is "clean" and structured but it is far from being optimal and it lacks proper
comments and documentation.
